This example is designed to demonstrate the performance of different
collections, if given the same input under the same circumstances. The 
trainees should see how different collections will organize and present
the data entered differently - i.e. some collections will maintain order
while others will not, the preservation of duplicates, etc. When
presenting this aspect, you should set the SAMPLE_LIMIT to a low value, 
10 is recommended.

This example also shows the amount of time it takes to store values and 
access values via the use of a stopwatch. For this part of the demonstration
you will want to set SAMPLE_LIMIT to a relatively high value, 100000 is 
recommended, to see significant differences between the collections.
